Simple Local Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe

This game requires two players. The in-game prompts make playing the game simple and easy!

I wanted to make my first project without the help of a guided tutorial.
I hope you enjoy playing!

I use lists and list indexes to display the board and determine whether moves are valid.
