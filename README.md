# tic-tac-toe
Simple Local Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe 


My first project in Python!
The code may not be the most efficient or clean possible, but I wanted to make a project without the help of a guided tutorial.
I hope you enjoy playing!

I use lists and list indexes to display the board and determine whether moves are valid.
